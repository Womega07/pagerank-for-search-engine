# Pagerank for Search Engine

# Project Deatils
PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.
Construct a Pagerank Model to maintain information about the connectivity of web-pages through a web matrix.
Optimized space by integrating the space Matrix(Implemented with Circular Multi-Linked List) to the model.
